# URLShortenerService

The project saves to both sql and an in-memory HashMap for faster access
To avoid SQL Server Setup, comment out all conditional statements and references to the URLDAO class
It generates a random code {LinkId} and attaches it as a path param to Domain Name "https://bit.ly/{LinkId}"
